Hi, long time no see!

There were lots of things I did these days.

Well, anyway, I won the best paper award in FAN2015!

And I just got started SLAM stuff for Tsukuba Challnege.

Also built up some environment setting on vim and git.
vim-prompt seems supur cool!

Anyway, I must learn ROS SLAM! Here we go!!!
