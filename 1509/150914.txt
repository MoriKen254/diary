It was midterm report day today.
That wasn't so bad. I'll keep it on.

By the way, I finally resume My 3d Printer stuff today.
Still 5 ones remains...

First, I'll finish all of them.
Second, learn TF stuff.
Third, practice vi book.
Finally, work on ROS book.

What about Tsukuba Challenge?
After Ryodo move on that!!!
