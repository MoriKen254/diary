I originally have to make a presentation slide for midterm report,
but I didn't get encouraed to do that.

Instead, I learned some vim tips again and started to clean up some messy
documents on my computers.

haha, how am I gonna go on tomorrow...

By the way, We went to Yakiniku!!! It was awesome!!!
It charged me a lot to promote myselef to work on presentation stuff.
